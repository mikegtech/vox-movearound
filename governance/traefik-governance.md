# Traefik Governance and Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines governance policies for Traefik reverse proxy deployment.

## Configuration Management

### 1. Static vs Dynamic Configuration
- **Static Configuration**: Infrastructure settings (ports, providers, logs)
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Routing rules, middlewares, services

### 2. Security Policies

#### TLS Configuration
- Minimum TLS version: 1.2
- Strong cipher suites only
- HSTS enabled with preload

#### Authentication
- Dashboard requires authentication
- API endpoints protected by API Gateway authorizer
- Metrics endpoint requires basic auth

### 3. Rate Limiting

Default limits per environment:
- **Development**: 100 req/min average, 200 burst
- **Staging**: 500 req/min average, 1000 burst  
- **Production**: 1000 req/min average, 2000 burst

### 4. Circuit Breaker

Triggers when:
- Network error ratio > 50%
- 5xx response ratio > 50%

Recovery after 10 seconds of stability.

### 5. Monitoring Requirements

#### Metrics
- Prometheus metrics exposed on `/metrics`
- CloudWatch metrics via ECS integration
- Custom metrics for business KPIs

#### Logging
- Structured JSON logs
- Exclude sensitive headers (Authorization)
- Retain for compliance period

### 6. Scaling Policies

#### Auto-scaling triggers:
- CPU utilization > 70%
- Request count > 1000/target
- Response time > 2s (p95)

#### Capacity planning:
- Min: 1 (dev), 2 (staging), 3 (production)
- Max: 10 (configurable)
